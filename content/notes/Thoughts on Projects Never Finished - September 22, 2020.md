Something that's been on my mind a lot this year in relation to my work is that of unfinished projects. I know that starting and not finishing (despite every intention to!) projects is something that's universal, but something I've in particular had a very hard time making peace with.

There have been so many times where I've started projects or outlined a blog post or sketched some ideaI could very clearly see in my mind in their final forms; finished and complete objects and artifacts. They would never reach that state though; either from lack of sustained interest, resources, time, or, most commonly; the temptation to start a *NEW* project.

It used to stress me out and frustrate me to no end that there I couldn't seem to finish every project that I started, but I've learned to make peace with it. 

Part of the reason I was stressed by this, I think, was that there all these things on my hard drive that "could" be finished, if only I just opened up the project and finished them...all sitting right next to things that either were already finished, or were being worked on at the time. 

I finally realized that the best thing to do would be to put any unfinished projects or blog posts in one, new folder so that I could signify to myself that these were things that were, almost certainly; never going to be "completed". 

I posted about this on Twitter, and got some really interesting responses:

It was heartening to see that this resonated with others; I really loved that [Lauren Valdez](https://twitter.com/TheLaurenValdez) drew parallels to the Marie Kondo method of tidying up:

I really liked what [Michael Usachenko](https://twitter.com/themichaelusa) did with for his unfinished open-source projects:

To that end, I made my own ["Graveyard" repository on GitHub](https://github.com/narner/graveyard). I originally balked at calling it the Graveyard, but on further reflection; it was clear that, to me,  this would be a "resting place" for projects and
