Delay Tracker was built to educate Amtrak passengers experiencing delays on their trip why those delays may be occuring, and to give them the opportunity to report the fact that their train was delayed to the Surface Transportation Board. 

This way, the Amtrak-riding public could both become educated about hte challenges to the nation's rail infrastructure, as well as have a way to ensure their complaints about their trip were heard. 

The app was written in Objective-C. [Tana Green](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tanagreen/) designed the interface.
