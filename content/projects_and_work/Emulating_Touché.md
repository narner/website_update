title: "Emulating Touché"

In 2017, I worked on a project where I built a circuit that emulated the [Touché
circuit from Disney Research](https://www.theverge.com/2012/5/6/3001269/disney-touche-swept-frequency-capacitive-touch-sensor).

I wanted to see if, using the circuit and machine-learning software, I could
replicate the results of the [Touché paper](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/disneyresearch/wp-content/uploads/20140805145650/touchechi20121.pdf) by training a system to detect how I
was touching various plants, or how to use [water as an interface]({{< ref "Touche, and Water as an Interface - August 15, 2017.md" >}}).

I wrote about these experiments in [Touché, and Water as an Interface](https://nickarner.com/notes/touche-and-water-as-an-interface-august-15-2017/), and [Talking to Plants: Touché Experiments.](https://nickarner.com/notes/talking-to-plants-touche-experiments-august-4-2017/)
