<i> Interfaces + Invention + Investing. Computers are great but they could be better. MacOS / iOS dev and occasional ML/HW tinkerer. </i>

![Nick](/headshot.jpg "l-float") I'm a developer and researcher working in the field of Human-Computer Interaction.  I live and work in San Francisco, California. 

I’m currently available for small freelance iOS / macOS development projects, as well as technical writing and research work. I’ve done work for companies such as Tlon, Dusty Robotics, Roboflow, and Meter. 

I've written a lot of software for work, open-source projects, freelance and personal projects. You can check out some of the stuff I've worked on on the [Projects](/projects_and_work) page.
