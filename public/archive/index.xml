      <description>AudioKit is an open-source audio analysis, synthesis, and processing toolkit for iOS and OS X apps. Now in its third version, I was involved in development, communication, and education since prior to the initial public release in 2014.
Prior to its initial public release, I helped prepare AudioKit for open-sourcing by creating example projects, writing tutorials, and creating website content. I also worked on features like framework testing, and what we internally called &amp;ldquo;Sensible Defaults&amp;rdquo; - the idea that programmers wanting to incorporate AudioKit into their projects who didn&amp;rsquo;t have an audio or music background could easily get get started with using audio objects thatt sounded good without having to tweak individual parameters to start.</description>
