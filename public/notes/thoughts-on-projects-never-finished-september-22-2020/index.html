			<p>Something that&rsquo;s been on my mind a lot this year in relation to my work is that of unfinished projects. I know that starting and not finishing (despite every intention to!) projects is something that&rsquo;s universal, but something I&rsquo;ve in particular had a very hard time making peace with.</p>
<p>There have been so many times where I&rsquo;ve started projects or outlined a blog post or sketched some ideaI could very clearly see in my mind in their final forms; finished and complete objects and artifacts. They would never reach that state though; either from lack of sustained interest, resources, time, or, most commonly; the temptation to start a <em>NEW</em> project.</p>
<p>It used to stress me out and frustrate me to no end that there I couldn&rsquo;t seem to finish every project that I started, but I&rsquo;ve learned to make peace with it.</p>
<p>Part of the reason I was stressed by this, I think, was that there all these things on my hard drive that &ldquo;could&rdquo; be finished, if only I just opened up the project and finished them&hellip;all sitting right next to things that either were already finished, or were being worked on at the time.</p>
<p>I finally realized that the best thing to do would be to put any unfinished projects or blog posts in one, new folder so that I could signify to myself that these were things that were, almost certainly; never going to be &ldquo;completed&rdquo;.</p>
<p>I posted about this on Twitter, and got some really interesting responses:</p>

<p>I particularly liked what <a href="https://twitter.com/MrCatid">Chris Taylor</a> had to say when reflecting on how it felt like there were so many things I started and didn&rsquo;t finish this year:</p>

<p> </p>
<p>It was heartening to see that this resonated with others; I really loved that <a href="https://twitter.com/TheLaurenValdez">Lauren Valdez</a> drew parallels to the Marie Kondo method of tidying up:</p>

<p>I really liked what <a href="https://twitter.com/themichaelusa">Michael Usachenko</a> did with for his unfinished open-source projects:</p>

<p> </p>
<p>To that end, I made my own <a href="https://github.com/narner/graveyard">&ldquo;Graveyard&rdquo; repository on GitHub</a>. I originally balked at calling it the Graveyard, but on further reflection; it was clear that, to me,  this would be a &ldquo;resting place&rdquo; for projects and</p>
