<p>Prior to its initial public release, I helped prepare AudioKit for open-sourcing by creating example projects, writing tutorials, and creating website content. I also worked on features like framework testing, and what we internally called &ldquo;Sensible Defaults&rdquo; - the idea that programmers wanting to incorporate AudioKit into their projects who didn&rsquo;t have an audio or music background could easily get get started with using audio objects thatt sounded good without having to tweak individual parameters to start. I created presets for a variety of audio synthesis objects that when used by a developer, would allow for a good template</p>
<p>For example, AudioKit has a variety of physical modelling objects. One of these is an object that will generate a bells sound; for that object, I created defaults that would sound like jingling bells when the audio was played.</p>
